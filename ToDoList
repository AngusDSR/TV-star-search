Current list of problems:

- add page icon: make better!
- favicon needs to work with dark mode
- generate alt text for 'cover art', or waste of attention? Get feedback.
- add a readme with a description and link to the live page (e.g. https://github.com/jostylr/mathpebbles)
- add 'more info' button with an SVC icon for the show (and main actor?)
- auto-scroll not working on mobile
- when there is no blurb/title, the show result div is narrow. No sign of padding, what's going on?

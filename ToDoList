Current list of problems:

- add page icon: make better!
- add 'more info' button with an SVC icon for the show (and main actor?)
- auto-scroll not quite working on mobile
- when there is no blurb/title, the shwo result div is narrow. No sign of padding, what's going on?
- placeholder actor image too wide. needs to be limited with a specific class.
